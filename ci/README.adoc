== Concourse pipeline

To set the pipeline first create a file in this directory called `secrets.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.secrets.yml
----
docker-hub-username: "<username>"
docker-hub-password: "<secret>"
github-username: "<username>"
github-password: "<secret>"
----

NOTE: The file should be ignored by git, make sure that you don't commit it!

Once the file has been created, the pipeline can be deployed:

[source]
----
$ fly -t spring set-pipeline -p artifactory-resource -c ci/pipeline.yml
----

=== Release

To perform a release run:

[source]
----
$ fly -t spring trigger-job -j artifactory-resource/release
----
